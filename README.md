# UFOs
## Overview
For this project, I will build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. I'll also create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. I'll customize my webpage using Bootstrap, and equip my table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the visualizations.

## Results
With the webpage complete, all the end user will have to do in order to search for the UFO data they want to find is to come over to the Filter Search section of the site. The user will have to type out either what date, city, state, country, or shape they are looking to find. Users can add as little to all the filters that they would like in order to narrow down their searches. By simply typing what they are looking for in the appropriate filter box and pressing enter that information on the table will come up with what the user wants to see. To the right of this filter box is the table with all the UFO sightings that the user may be intrested in. By filtering the table, the end user will be able to easily find which UFO sighting they were searching for.

## Summary
This webpage creates an easy to use filter system for all the UFO fanatics out there. All the alien sighting data is in one place so users can easily find the data that they are looking for. 

### Drawback to Webpage
- Although the website is easy to use, the one drawback I would say is that the way you have to type into the filter box can become tricky if the user is not using the correct type of characters. For example, if the user wants to search for data in the city of La Mesa they will have to type everything in lower case. If they type anything in uppercase in the filter boxes then nothing will show up. Same goes for if the user decides to type the full name of the state, this will not properly filter the data as nothing will show up. The user will have to be aware to type everything in lowercase and only type the intials for the state and country.

### Recommendations for Further Development
- To add to the webpage, it would be a good idea to add a reset filters button at the bottom of the "Filters Search" section as this would allow for easy removal of the filters. This would make it easier for the user to delete the filters they had added in order to search for other criterias more easily. 

- The second recommendation I have is to have a filter for just the year. It can be tricky to search for an exact date as there might not even be a specific date in mind from the users standpoint. Having a filter for the year would be more useful and user centered.
